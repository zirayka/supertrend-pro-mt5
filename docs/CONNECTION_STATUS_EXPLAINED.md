# Connection Status Explained

## Current Situation ✅

Your setup is working correctly! Here's what's happening:

### 1. WebSocket Connection Fails (Expected) ❌
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8765/' failed
```
**This is normal!** Your MT5 Expert Advisor is **file-based**, not WebSocket-based.

### 2. File-Based Connection Works ✅
Your MT5 EA is writing files to:
```
C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\Common\Files\
```

The web application reads these files via the file server on port 3001.

## How Your System Works

```
MT5 Terminal → Expert Advisor → JSON Files → File Server → Web App
```

1. **MT5 Expert Advisor** writes data to JSON files every few seconds
2. **File Server** (port 3001) serves these files via HTTP
3. **Web Application** reads files and displays live data

## Connection Modes

### 🔌 WebSocket Mode (Not Used)
- Direct real-time connection to MT5
- Requires WebSocket server in MT5
- Your EA doesn't have this (and doesn't need it!)

### 📁 File Mode (Your Current Setup) ✅
- MT5 writes files, web app reads files
- Reliable and simple
- Perfect for your use case
- Updates every 2 seconds

### 🎮 Demo Mode (Fallback)
- Simulated market data
- Used when no MT5 connection available

## Why WebSocket Errors Don't Matter

The WebSocket errors you see are just the system **trying WebSocket first**, then **falling back to file mode**. This is the intended behavior!

Your system should show:
- **Mode**: "MT5 Live" (when files are accessible)
- **Status**: Green connection indicator
- **Data**: Real prices from your MT5 Terminal

## Troubleshooting Steps

### If Still Showing "Demo Mode":

1. **Check File Server Running**:
   ```bash
   npm run mt5-server
   ```
   Should show: `✅ MT5 File Server started successfully!`

2. **Check Files Exist**:
   Navigate to: `%APPDATA%\MetaQuotes\Terminal\Common\Files\`
   Should see: `tick_data.json`, `account_info.json`, etc.

3. **Test File Access**:
   Open: `http://localhost:3001/status`
   Should show available files

4. **Check MT5 EA**:
   In MT5 Expert tab, should see:
   ```
   Account info sent - Balance: 100.00 | File written: YES
   Tick sent for BTCUSD: Bid=107652.56 | File written: YES
   ```

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Normal Startup Sequence:
1. `🔌 Attempting WebSocket connection...` (fails - normal)
2. `📁 Attempting file-based connection...` (succeeds)
3. `✅ File-based connection to MT5 successful`
4. `📄 Found files: tick_data.json, account_info.json...`
5. Web app shows "MT5 Live" mode

### ❌ If Problems:
- WebSocket errors are **normal and expected**
- Only worry if file connection also fails
- Check that file server is running on port 3001
- Verify MT5 EA is creating files

## Summary

Your WebSocket connection errors are **completely normal**! Your system is designed to use file-based communication, which is more reliable for your setup. The web application should automatically switch to "MT5 Live" mode once it detects the files from your Expert Advisor.

Focus on:
1. ✅ File server running (port 3001)
2. ✅ MT5 EA creating files
3. ✅ Web app reading files successfully

The WebSocket errors can be safely ignored! 🚀
