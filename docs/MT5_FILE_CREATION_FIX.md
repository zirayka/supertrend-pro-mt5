# MT5 File Creation Fix - URGENT

## Problem Identified âœ…

Your MT5 Expert Advisor is running and logging data, but **JSON files are NOT being created**. This is a file permissions issue.

## Immediate Solution

### Step 1: Replace Your Expert Advisor
1. Open MetaEditor (F4 in MT5)
2. Open your current `SuperTrendBridge.mq5`
3. **Replace ALL code** with the new version (see `MT5_EA_FIXED_V2.mq5`)
4. Press **F7** to compile
5. Should show: `0 errors, 0 warnings`

### Step 2: Fix File Permissions
1. **Close MT5 completely**
2. **Right-click** on `MT5 Terminal64.exe`
3. Select **"Run as administrator"**
4. Reopen MT5 and attach the new Expert Advisor

### Step 3: Verify Settings
In MT5: **Tools â†’ Options â†’ Expert Advisors**
- âœ… Allow automated trading
- âœ… Allow DLL imports  
- âœ… Allow imports of external experts
- âœ… Allow modification of Signals settings

## What the New EA Does

### Enhanced Error Detection
- âœ… **File writing test** on startup
- âœ… **Detailed error messages** with solutions
- âœ… **System path information** for debugging
- âœ… **Better error handling** for each file operation

### Improved Logging
```
=== SuperTrend Bridge v2.0 Starting ===
=== SYSTEM INFORMATION ===
Terminal Path: C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 5\
Common Data Path: C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\Common\
âœ… File writing test successful!
âœ… Bytes written: 45
Account info sent - Balance: 100.00 | File written: YES
Tick sent for BTCUSD: Bid=107652.56 Ask=107677.95 | File written: YES
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Press 'T'**: Test file writing capability
- **Press 'P'**: Print file paths and system info
- **Press 'S'**: Manually send symbols list
- **Press 'A'**: Manually send account info
- **Press 'H'**: Show help menu

## Expected Results

After fixing, you should see:
```
âœ… File writing test successful!
âœ… Successfully wrote 278 bytes to tick_data.json
âœ… Successfully wrote 378 bytes to account_info.json
âœ… Successfully wrote 334 bytes to symbols_list.json
```

And these files will be created in:
```
C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\Common\Files\
```

## If Still Not Working

### Check These Locations:
1. **Common Files** (preferred):
   ```
   %APPDATA%\MetaQuotes\Terminal\Common\Files\
   ```

2. **Terminal-specific Files**:
   ```
   %APPDATA%\MetaQuotes\Terminal\[TerminalID]\MQL5\Files\
   ```

### Advanced Troubleshooting:
1. **Press 'P'** on chart to see exact paths
2. **Check Windows Event Viewer** for access denied errors
3. **Temporarily disable antivirus** to test
4. **Try different MT5 installation** if broker-specific

### Error Code Solutions:
- **5002**: Run MT5 as Administrator
- **5004**: Check file permissions in Windows
- **5018**: Enable file operations in Expert Advisors settings
- **4103**: Close any programs that might lock the files

## Test the Fix

1. **Attach new EA** to any chart
2. **Watch Expert tab** for success messages
3. **Press 'T'** to test file writing
4. **Navigate to Common\Files** folder
5. **Should see 4 JSON files** being created/updated

The new Expert Advisor will tell you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it! ðŸš€
